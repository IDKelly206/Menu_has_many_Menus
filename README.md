Menu_has_many_Meals

A personal project of Ian Kelly.

The objective is to solve the age-old inconvenience of handwritten grocery lists. Family meal planning presents numerous challenges to the household chef on a weekly basis. The service enables a household to plan a meal for a combination of household diners with each diners specific dietary restrictions automatically filtering the search. Selection of a recipe for a meal calculates the necessary amount of grocery items to fulfill the number of diners based on the serving size of the recipe.

The project is in a constant state of work in progress.
Tasks on the horizon include:
~ Planner course display sectioned to course#index via turbo frame display.
~ Improve API processing by utlizing Sidekiq
~ Address processing times due to n+1 issues by using Bullet gem
